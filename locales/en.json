I wanted a tool that was fast, simple, and actually enjoyable to use — something that helps you stay in control without overwhelming you with charts, categories, or rules. What started as a small side project to organize my own finances grew into a clean, intuitive app that people around me began asking for. My goal is simple: make personal finance easy, clear, and stress-free for everyone.",
